* to see with Mark:

- make game 20% faster (60Hz)

* can be worked on my own:

- bonus flag is mirrored!
- hotkey (f1?) to toggle music: not working yet
- still some flashing (missing sprites, level 14)
- andor sprite flickers when appearing
- andor sprite trashed the second time it appears
- andor bombing doesn't work too well: test on MAME
- andor genesis sound replays: should lock timer
- implement dip switches screen ??
- not booting from real machine on CF card without whdload
- change improve FG tile handling: 
  write into a backbuffer (1 plane) and blit only rows that were changed using a
  "dirty" array
- optimize BG draw more?

further optims:

- 1 color lost because of fg tiles: not useable color is color 17: it is the color of the FG tiles
  we _could_ use it with a hack in the FG row copperlist (no color change) when nothing is displayed...
- a lot of blank sprites should just be NOT drawn (ex: clut 0)
- don't generate mirror X-sprites if log doesn't tell game is using it
- if no tile can be double width / double height AND simple at the same time
  generate 16x32,32x16,32x32 bob data directly for a fewer number of blits
- optim: cookie cut with fixed B=0 source if plane_pic_0 (saves bandwidth)! blit_plane_any_internal_cookie_cut_blank_source
- find a way to make up for those still slightly shaking ground enemies
