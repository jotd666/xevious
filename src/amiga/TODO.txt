* to see with Mark:

- sprite shadow management: complete?
- sprite attributes to code (ship explosion looks wrong): double height bit 1 of attrs double width bit 0 of attrs
- better 16-color palette for tiles, 16-color palette for sprites
- when killed, previous enemy sprites not reset?

* can be worked on my own:

- sprites for ship, bomb sight and shots and bomb!: superimpose 2 sprites to get more colors
- for fg title tile flash, try to get colored tiles
- update sprites in 2 passes: not ok unless we sort by sprite y max
   -> 0-32: update high sprites,
   -> 32-63 update low sprites
- small scrolling issues? (planes don't all scroll on top sometimes?, 
  like when scroll offset = exactly 0)
- rip sounds
