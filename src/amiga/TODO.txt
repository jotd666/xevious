* to see with Mark:

- sprite shadow management: complete?

* can be worked on my own:

- sprite attributes to code (ship explosion looks wrong): double height bit 1 of attrs double width bit 0 of attrs
- fg tile refresh
- sprites for big mothership (allows to use alternate brown/gold colors)
- colored "hiscore" & "namco" 
- update sprites in 2 passes: not ok unless we sort by sprite y max
   -> 0-32: update high sprites,
   -> 32-63 update low sprites
- rip sounds
- save/load hiscore
- crosshairs CLUTs too many cluts, wrong cluts
- trashed gfx when dropping bomb (snoop?)
- without whdload: screen garbled
- when killed, previous enemy sprites not reset? (see Mark mail)
"Yes, you need to deactivate/hide/remove sprites with STATE=0 in the
osd_update_sprite_shadow routine. I think on Xevious hardware that was
simply done by setting X=0 & Y=0. On the Neo Geo that (sort of) hides
them behind the display masking sprites, but doesn't deactivate them, so
I have to do that (as well).

On the Amiga because you don't have hardware sprite registers (for the
most part) you'd have to either explicitly remove them in there, or -
better yet - remove them during osd_update_32_sprite_hw after flagging
them somehow in the update routine (maybe don't update the state until
here)."
