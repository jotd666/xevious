
- optim to include ram source for pc relative addressing

further optims/fixes:

- highscore yellow highlight shifted for entry 3 (change score and run with 1 life)
- optim: cookie cut with fixed B=0 source if plane_pic_0 (saves bandwidth)! blit_plane_any_internal_cookie_cut_blank_source
- if no tile can be double width / double height AND simple at the same time
  generate 16x32,32x16,32x32 bob data directly for a fewer number of blits
- 1 color lost because of fg tiles: not useable color is color 17: it is the color of the FG tiles
  we _could_ use it with a hack in the FG row copperlist (no color change) when nothing is displayed...
- a lot of blank sprites should just be NOT drawn (ex: clut 0)
- don't generate mirror X-sprites like ... at all? do the game use those?
  (saves 130kb, not worth it)
  
  
Super Xevious additions (taken from http://retroports.blogspot.com/)

Galaxian; technically worth 150 pts but you can't actually hit it. Always spawns away from the Solvalou, and will turn away before you can get under it. Shoots at you though.
Jet Taking Off; appears once (area 10). Unique in that it is a flying enemy, but shooting it results in a crater on the ground. You can't get close enough for it to hit the Solvalou before it leaves the screen, Don't shoot it - you have been warned!
Jet; the most pointless addition. Appears once (area 15). Flies down the screen at a random (relatively shallow) angle but is completely and utterly benign. It can't hurt you, and you can't destroy it. What was the point?
Helicopter; appears once (area 14). Don't bomb it - you have been warned!
Tank; appears once (area 8). Don't bomb it - you have been warned!
Bridge; appears once (area 15) and is purely cosmetic (completely benign). 'Allows' the Domograms to cross the river.
