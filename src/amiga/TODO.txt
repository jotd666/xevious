* to see with Mark:

- still some explosion "replica" on the top of screen, only happens
  when shooting enemies
  
* can be worked on my own:

- change improve FG tile handling: in progress, partially working
- make game 20% faster (60Hz): done, must test
- strange graphical corruption at some point in the level ????
- bonus flag is mirrored! check flag code, activate cheat and break here
- hotkey (f1?) to toggle music: not working yet
- still some flashing (missing sprites, level 14)
- andor sprite flickers when appearing: log andor Y values
- andor sprite trashed when it appears
- andor bombing doesn't work too well: test on MAME
- implement dip switches screen ??
- optimize BG draw more

further optims:

- 1 color lost because of fg tiles: not useable color is color 17: it is the color of the FG tiles
  we _could_ use it with a hack in the FG row copperlist (no color change) when nothing is displayed...
- a lot of blank sprites should just be NOT drawn (ex: clut 0)
- don't generate mirror X-sprites if log doesn't tell game is using it
- if no tile can be double width / double height AND simple at the same time
  generate 16x32,32x16,32x32 bob data directly for a fewer number of blits
- optim: cookie cut with fixed B=0 source if plane_pic_0 (saves bandwidth)! blit_plane_any_internal_cookie_cut_blank_source
- find a way to make up for those still slightly shaking ground enemies
