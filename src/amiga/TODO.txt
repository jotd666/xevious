* to see with Mark:

- sprite shadow management: complete?

* can be worked on my own:

- sprite attributes double height/width small issues
- sprites for big mothership (allows to use alternate brown/gold colors): set section 14
- rip sounds
- without whdload: screen garbled
- find a way to make up for those shaking ground enemies
- keyboard interrupt to insert coin & start game
- find a way to NOT use color17 so FG color doesn't interfere with sprites
- enemies #21 not displayed: invisible/just one pixel enemies (because palette issues?) strange as they
  used to be displayed properly in previous versions

further optims:

- cookie cut with fixed 0 source if plane_pic_0 (saves bandwidth)
- generate NOT tables for FG tiles to optimize tile refresh
- don't generate mirror X-sprites if log doesn't tell game is using it
