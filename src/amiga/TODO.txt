* to see with Mark:

- find a way to make up for those shaking ground enemies
- optimize main/sub code more
- level 14: black balls start with 4 toroids!!

* can be worked on my own:

- display sprite at y=0 doesn't work, only works with y>=16: store_sprite_pos
  certainly receives trash when y=0, because it should work (0x2C => 0x1C in table does the job)
- when Andrej provides the music, up sampling rate to 22 or 28k
- andor appearing sprite clipping is trashing the sprite, backup not working
- andor center tile is still a bob (is that a problem?)
- sprite lifetime system is not working for clipped y sprites as zeroing
  the base address X/Y isn't effective if sprite is being clipped: should
  reset the sprite pointer too
- real machine: currently lockup at start without whdload => still lockup on real machine, try from fastmem
- real machine: test with more fps / enemies
- real machine: fg tile refresh on "XEVIOUS" title slows down a lot: re-test
  maybe create a big BOB and blit it instead, skip that fg
  tile write completely since nothing else is ever written there
  (when in "game" mode not "menu"/"title" mode)
- glitter sprite is flashing. revert to BOB (WinUAE only issue)
- sprites for big mothership: test including sprite clipping
- title tiles missing (level 14) title tiles also with brown color config???
  related to hole in map???
- check if tiles missing (wrongly??) in level 1 too!!
  probably related to warning (improve the warning): 22:64: <PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=8x8 at 0x187C30614F0>: (x=0,y=0) rounded color (81, 81, 81) (#515151) not found, orig color (81, 81, 81) (#515151), maybe try adjusting precision mask 0 close colors: []
- dip switches screen
- level 14: tile layout looks wrong (bird drawing)
- solvalou sprite flickering on emulator. Check real hardware: check if lifetime is broken when not hit
- optim: erase width & offset instead of 18 height
- during the demo, insert a coin, double buffering ghost images remain
  workaround: always clear drawing screen when switching tile palettes
  (going from game to intro)
- sheonite sprites too fast, seem to fail the sprite erase phase
  or maybe because too close to the right of the screen?


further optims:

- main theme lock music counter: rather use a vbl counter because frameskip
  can vary
- 1 color lost because of fg tiles: not useable color is color 17: it is the color of the FG tiles
  we _could_ use it with a hack in the FG row copperlist (no color change) when nothing is displayed...
- a lot of blank sprites should just be NOT drawn (ex: clut 0)
- cookie cut with fixed 0 source if plane_pic_0 (saves bandwidth)
- don't generate mirror X-sprites if log doesn't tell game is using it
- if no tile can be double width / double height AND simple at the same time
  generate 16x32,32x16,32x32 bob data directly for a fewer number of blits
