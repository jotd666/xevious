* to see with Mark:

- sprite shadow management: complete?
  probably not for double width/height objects
- find a way to make up for those shaking ground enemies
- sound playing in attract mode
- optimize main/sub code more

* can be worked on my own:

- real machine: retry without loadview (no whdload) (currently lockup)
- real machine: flickering re-test with big number of enemies
- real machine: fg tile refresh on "XEVIOUS" title slows down a lot
  maybe create a big BOB and blit it instead, skip that fg
  tile write completely since nothing else is ever written there?
- generate NOT tables for FG tiles to optimize tile refresh (won't be enough)
- andor sprite remains on the bottom of the screen once destroyed: re-test
- glitter sprite is flashing. revert to BOB (WinUAE only issue)
- sprites for big mothership: test including sprite clipping
- display sprite at y=0 doesn't work, only works with y>=16
- title tiles missing (level 14) title tiles also with brown color config???
  related to hole in map???
- check if tiles missing (wrongly??) in level 1 too!!
  probably related to warning (improve the warning): 22:64: <PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=8x8 at 0x187C30614F0>: (x=0,y=0) rounded color (81, 81, 81) (#515151) not found, orig color (81, 81, 81) (#515151), maybe try adjusting precision mask 0 close colors: []
- dip switches screen
- level 14: tile layout looks wrong (bird drawing)
- sheonite sprites too fast, seem to fail the sprite erase phase
  workaround (maybe): if sheonite on screen, clear all screen (no biggie
  because nothing else is displayed on screen)

further optims:

- 1 color lost because of fg tiles: not useable color is color 17: it is the color of the FG tiles
  we _could_ use it with a hack in the FG row copperlist (no color change) when nothing is displayed...
- a lot of blank sprites should just be NOT drawn (ex: clut 0)
- cookie cut with fixed 0 source if plane_pic_0 (saves bandwidth)
- don't generate mirror X-sprites if log doesn't tell game is using it
- if no tile can be double width / double height AND simple at the same time
  generate 16x32,32x16,32x32 bob data directly for a fewer number of blits
