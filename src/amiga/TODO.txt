* to see with Mark:

- still some explosion "replica" on the top of screen, only happens
  when shooting enemies
  
* can be worked on my own:

- change improve FG tile handling: in progress, partially working
  => clear not working 100% debug title screen (insert coin flash)
- make game 20% faster (60Hz): done, must test
- hotkey (f1?) to toggle music: not working yet
- andor sprite trashed when it appears if slow amiga: line backup seems to fail / be late
  when y value is repeated seems to backup wrong!!
- implement dip switches screen ?? stopping the irq and using xevious font to display a menu,
   using the fg tile engine (backuping the state before & restoring after). 
- adapt to Super Xevious
- don't generate mirror X-sprites like ... at all? do the game use those?

further optims:

- bg tile for in-game when needs to refresh at 2 locations maybe
  detect the end of a row, then blit copy the whole row
- 1 color lost because of fg tiles: not useable color is color 17: it is the color of the FG tiles
  we _could_ use it with a hack in the FG row copperlist (no color change) when nothing is displayed...
- a lot of blank sprites should just be NOT drawn (ex: clut 0)
- if no tile can be double width / double height AND simple at the same time
  generate 16x32,32x16,32x32 bob data directly for a fewer number of blits
- optim: cookie cut with fixed B=0 source if plane_pic_0 (saves bandwidth)! blit_plane_any_internal_cookie_cut_blank_source
- find a way to make up for those still slightly shaking ground enemies
