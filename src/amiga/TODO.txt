* to see with Mark:

- sprite shadow management: complete?

* can be worked on my own:

- sprite attributes to code (ship explosion looks wrong): double height bit 1 of attrs double width bit 0 of attrs
- fg tile refresh not right
- sprites for big mothership (allows to use alternate brown/gold colors)
- colored "hiscore" & "namco" 
- double buffering on sprite layer to avoid flicker: maybe not needed
- rip sounds
- save/load hiscore
- without whdload: screen garbled

- copper interrupt too soon, got to wait less maybe before
  let PAL limit work
- adjust erase (again!)
- use cpu bitplane clear on odd planes (optim)
