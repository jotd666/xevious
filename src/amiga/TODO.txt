* to see with Mark:

- sprite shadow management: complete?

* can be worked on my own:

- dump sprites in one image without palette (to test sprite attributes)
- sprite attributes to code (ship explosion looks wrong): double height bit 1 of attrs double width bit 0 of attrs
- sprites for big mothership (allows to use alternate brown/gold colors): set section 14
- properly colored "hiscore"
- rip sounds
- without whdload: screen garbled
- killed: last position of sprites isn't erased (discontinuous) for
  lower part objects (d0=32): remove y flip flop update everythin
  everytime to test
- optim: cookie cut with fixed 0 source if plane_pic_0 (saves bandwidth)
