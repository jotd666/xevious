* to see with Mark:

- sprite shadow management: complete?

* can be worked on my own:

- dump sprites in one image without palette (to test sprite attributes)
- dump sprites in original colors and reduced colors
- sprite attributes to code (ship explosion looks wrong): double height bit 1 of attrs double width bit 0 of attrs
- sprites for big mothership (allows to use alternate brown/gold colors): set section 14
- invisible enemies because palette issues
- rip sounds
- without whdload: screen garbled
- find a way to make up for those shaking ground enemies
- keyboard interrupt to insert coin & start game

further optims:

- cookie cut with fixed 0 source if plane_pic_0 (saves bandwidth)
- generate NOT tables for FG tiles to optimize tile refresh
