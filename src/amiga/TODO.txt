* to see with Mark:

- still some explosion "replica" on the top of screen, only happens
  when shooting enemies: probably animation frame of previous exploding toroid reused for new
  appearing toroid and not reset
  
* can be worked on my own:

* critical:

- number of credits not erased (pixels accumulate)

* not urgent

- andor sprite flashing when appearing sometimes
- hotkey (f1?) to toggle music: not working yet, disabled
- make game 20% faster (60Hz): done, not working...
- random?: access fault far in the game (in draw_sprite_part)
- highscore yellow highlight shifted

* Super Xevious only

- play and log the missing clut/sprites: log in 0x110: rip galaxian
- level 15 bridge: use special assembled sprite: wrong x size WTF
- tank & heli (levl 14) wrong colors / blinking: maybe dump sprite config & test
- dynamic Xevious/Super Xevious config at launch (whdload)
- where does galaxian appear?? what's it's tile code?

further optims:

- if no tile can be double width / double height AND simple at the same time
  generate 16x32,32x16,32x32 bob data directly for a fewer number of blits
- bg tile for in-game when needs to refresh at 2 locations maybe
  detect the end of a row, then blit copy the whole row
- 1 color lost because of fg tiles: not useable color is color 17: it is the color of the FG tiles
  we _could_ use it with a hack in the FG row copperlist (no color change) when nothing is displayed...
- a lot of blank sprites should just be NOT drawn (ex: clut 0)
- optim: cookie cut with fixed B=0 source if plane_pic_0 (saves bandwidth)! blit_plane_any_internal_cookie_cut_blank_source
- find a way to make up for those still slightly shaking ground enemies
- don't generate mirror X-sprites like ... at all? do the game use those?
  (saves 130kb, not worth it)
  
  
Super Xevious

    Galaxian; technically worth 150 pts but you can't actually hit it. Always spawns away from the Solvalou, and will turn away before you can get under it. Shoots at you though.
    Jet; the most pointless addition. Appears once (area 15). Flies down the screen at a random (relatively shallow) angle but is completely and utterly benign. It can't hurt you, and you can't destroy it. What was the point?
    Helicopter; appears once (area 14). Don't bomb it - you have been warned!
    Tank; appears once (area 8). Don't bomb it - you have been warned!
    Bridge; appears once (area 15) and is purely cosmetic (completely benign). 'Allows' the Domograms to cross the river.
