* to see with Mark:

- sprite shadow management: complete?
- crosshairs CLUTs too many cluts (all cluts are used!)

* can be worked on my own:

- sprite attributes to code (ship explosion looks wrong): double height bit 1 of attrs double width bit 0 of attrs
- fg tile refresh not right
- bg partially destroyed (by fg sprite clear probably)
- sprites for big mothership (allows to use alternate brown/gold colors)
- colored "hiscore" & "namco" 
- double buffering (ATM disabled) on sprite layer to avoid flicker: in progress
- rip sounds
- save/load hiscore
- trashed gfx when dropping bomb (snoop?)
- without whdload: screen garbled
