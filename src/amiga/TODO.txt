* to see with Mark:

- find a way to make up for those shaking ground enemies
- optimize main/sub code more
- level 14: black balls start with 4 toroids!!
- random! as soon as bacuras appear, solvalou explodes even if no collision (area 3?)

* can be worked on my own:

- adjust literal offsets in sprite backup routine as all fields
  are now doubled
- 4 red glowing hulls of andor genesis HW sprite should be overlayed with
  BOBO (even if golden colors are blacked out) just to be
  able to be shut down by bombs (core is already a BOB)
- when a sprite is reused (ex: title spark) the lifetime of old sprites (now switched)
  make current sprite flicker
- andor genesis sound replays: should lock timer
- still missing sprites at area 14? (blue flashes)
- crash in draw_sprite_part (area 14): log parameters? (maybe because of bad andor clipping too)
- andor appearing sprite clipping is trashing the sprite, backup not working
- andor center tile is still a bob (is that a problem?)
- sprite backup system is not working for clipped y sprites as zeroing
  the base address X/Y isn't effective if sprite is being clipped: should
  reset the sprite pointer too
- real machine: currently lockup at start without whdload => still lockup on real machine
  add multiple blitz+delay after forbid?
- title tiles missing (level 14) title tiles also with brown color config???
  related to hole in map???
  probably related to warning (improve the warning): 22:64: <PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=8x8 at 0x187C30614F0>: (x=0,y=0) rounded color (81, 81, 81) (#515151) not found, orig color (81, 81, 81) (#515151), maybe try adjusting precision mask 0 close colors: []
- level 14: tile layout looks wrong (bird drawing)
- sheonite sprites too fast, seem to fail the sprite erase: log shenonite display & erase coords (code 48-57)
- implement dip switches screen ??
- optim: cookie cut with fixed B=0 source if plane_pic_0 (saves bandwidth)! blit_plane_any_internal_cookie_cut_blank_source


further optims:

- 1 color lost because of fg tiles: not useable color is color 17: it is the color of the FG tiles
  we _could_ use it with a hack in the FG row copperlist (no color change) when nothing is displayed...
- a lot of blank sprites should just be NOT drawn (ex: clut 0)
- don't generate mirror X-sprites if log doesn't tell game is using it
- if no tile can be double width / double height AND simple at the same time
  generate 16x32,32x16,32x32 bob data directly for a fewer number of blits
