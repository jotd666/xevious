* to see with Mark:

- sprite shadow management: complete?
  probably not for double width/height objects
- find a way to make up for those shaking ground enemies
- level 14: tile layout looks wrong (bird drawing)
- music is played each frame: must be fixed in main

* can be worked on my own:

- generate all andor sprite color configs (glowing reds)
- glitter sprite is flashing. revert to BOB ??
- sol tower revealing is ok, but in the end tiles are reverted,
  (something is not clear for double height objects: handle with special case
  and that's it? check a video
- test mode to include andor_sprites_dump_2/andor_sprites_dump_1
  to display those sprites: done, complete it
- sprites for big mothership: test including sprite clipping
- title tiles missing (level 14) title tiles also with brown color config???
  related to hole in map???
- check if tiles missing (wrongly??) in level 1 too!!
  probably related to warning (improve the warning): 22:64: <PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=8x8 at 0x187C30614F0>: (x=0,y=0) rounded color (81, 81, 81) (#515151) not found, orig color (81, 81, 81) (#515151), maybe try adjusting precision mask 0 close colors: []
- how to display sprites with y<0 (y clip): will need manual y clipping DAMN!!
- running outside whdload: display trashed if started from an already open
  DOS command (OK from startup, no display enabled)
- dip switches screen
- pause
- sheonite sprites too fast, seem to fail the sprite erase phase
  workaround (maybe): if sheonite on screen, clear all screen (no biggie
  because nothing else is displayed on screen)
- dynamic sprite priority change for andor genesis
  andor genesis sprites should be below other ships
- do not include bitmaps for andor genesis or other sprites
- 1 color lost because of fg tiles: not useable color is color 17: it is the color of the FG tiles
  we _could_ use it with a hack in the FG row copperlist (no color change) when nothing is displayed...

further optims:

- a lot of blank sprites should just be NOT drawn (ex: clut 0)
- cookie cut with fixed 0 source if plane_pic_0 (saves bandwidth)
- generate NOT tables for FG tiles to optimize tile refresh
- don't generate mirror X-sprites if log doesn't tell game is using it
- if no tile can be double width / double height AND simple at the same time
  generate 16x32,32x16,32x32 bob data directly for a fewer number of blits
