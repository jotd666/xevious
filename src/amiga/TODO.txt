* to see with Mark:

- sprite shadow management: complete?

* can be worked on my own:

- button pulse pour hiscore entry NW
- dump sprites in one image without palette
- sprite attributes to code (ship explosion looks wrong): double height bit 1 of attrs double width bit 0 of attrs
- fg tile refresh not right for scores
- sprites for big mothership (allows to use alternate brown/gold colors): set section 14
- colored "hiscore"
- double buffering on sprite layer to avoid flicker: in test
- rip sounds
- without whdload: screen garbled
- killed: last position of sprites isn't erased (discontinuous) for
  lower part objects (d0=32)
- optim: cookie cut with fixed 0 source if plane_pic_0 (saves bandwidth)
