* to see with Mark:

- sprite shadow management: complete?
- find a way to make up for those shaking ground enemies

* can be worked on my own:

- sprites for big mothership (allows to use alternate brown/gold colors): set section 14
- rip sounds
- find a way to NOT use color17 so FG color doesn't interfere with sprites
- black small balls enemies not displayed: make a difference
  between black and transparent color
- still some missing tiles (zone 14)

further optims:

- reduce y height + introduce y offset for bobs
- cookie cut with fixed 0 source if plane_pic_0 (saves bandwidth)
- generate NOT tables for FG tiles to optimize tile refresh
- don't generate mirror X-sprites if log doesn't tell game is using it
- if no tile can be double width / double height AND simple at the same time
  generate 16x32,32x16,32x32 bob data directly for a fewer number of blits
