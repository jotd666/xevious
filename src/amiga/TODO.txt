* to see with Mark:

  
* can be worked on my own:

* critical:

- game => menu palette: also clear both double buffered screens

* not urgent

- highscore yellow highlight shifted (change score and run with 1 life)
- optim: fg tile draw compute min & max X for current box
- optim: cookie cut with fixed B=0 source if plane_pic_0 (saves bandwidth)! blit_plane_any_internal_cookie_cut_blank_source
- make game 20% faster (60Hz): done, probably not working...
- random?: access fault far in the game (in draw_sprite_part)

* Super Xevious only

- level 15 bridge: use special assembled sprite: wrong x size WTF check auto resize
  in bitplanelib
- tank & heli (levl 14) wrong colors / blinking: maybe dump sprite config & test

further optims:

- if no tile can be double width / double height AND simple at the same time
  generate 16x32,32x16,32x32 bob data directly for a fewer number of blits
- 1 color lost because of fg tiles: not useable color is color 17: it is the color of the FG tiles
  we _could_ use it with a hack in the FG row copperlist (no color change) when nothing is displayed...
- a lot of blank sprites should just be NOT drawn (ex: clut 0)
- find a way to make up for those still slightly shaking ground enemies
- don't generate mirror X-sprites like ... at all? do the game use those?
  (saves 130kb, not worth it)
  
  
Super Xevious

    Jet; the most pointless addition. Appears once (area 15). 
	Flies down the screen at a random (relatively shallow) angle but is completely and utterly benign. It can't hurt you, and you can't destroy it. What was the point?
    Helicopter; appears once (area 14). Don't bomb it - you have been warned!
    Tank; appears once (area 8). Don't bomb it - you have been warned!
    Bridge; appears once (area 15) and is purely cosmetic (completely benign). 'Allows' the Domograms to cross the river.
