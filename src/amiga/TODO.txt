* to see with Mark:

- find a way to make up for those shaking ground enemies
- make game 20% faster (60Hz)

* can be worked on my own:

- bonus flag is mirrored!
- hotkey (f1?) to toggle music: not working yet
- still some flashing (missing sprites, level 14)
- andor sprite flickers when appearing
- andor sprite trashed the second time it appears
- andor bombing doesn't work too well: test on real machine
- andor genesis sound replays: should lock timer
- andor sprite doesn't disappear completely (only second part is hidden) on the bottom part
- implement dip switches screen ??
- not booting from real machine on CF card without whdload

further optims:

- optimize main/sub code more
- 1 color lost because of fg tiles: not useable color is color 17: it is the color of the FG tiles
  we _could_ use it with a hack in the FG row copperlist (no color change) when nothing is displayed...
- a lot of blank sprites should just be NOT drawn (ex: clut 0)
- don't generate mirror X-sprites if log doesn't tell game is using it
- if no tile can be double width / double height AND simple at the same time
  generate 16x32,32x16,32x32 bob data directly for a fewer number of blits
- optim: cookie cut with fixed B=0 source if plane_pic_0 (saves bandwidth)! blit_plane_any_internal_cookie_cut_blank_source
- big flickering if game is running on chipmem
  * partially because of fg tile refresh which is very CPU intensive
  -> in menu mode, no BOBs => no need to update fg tiles
  -> in game mode, could write into a backbuffer (1 plane) and blit only 
     parts like score, remaining ships and optionally start message/game over regions
  * but even without it where there are more than 5 or 6 objects it flickers
    (maybe double buffering issue)
