missing last row
Just a thought, are you display the correct section of the map based on
the hardware scroll register?

The *bottom* row on the screen is (24-(scroll_register>>3))&63.

So in theory the top row visible (Neo Geo references the bottom only) is
something like (60-(scroll_register>>3))&63???
