* to see with Mark:

rip sounds
sprite shadow management: complete?
sprite attributes to code (ship explosion looks wrong): double height bit 1 of attrs double width bit 0 of attrs
small scrolling issues? (planes don't all scroll on top sometimes?, 
like when scroll offset = exactly 0)

* not an issue if AGA DPF:
 
background restore not optimal at all
if bob moves exactly like tiles don't redraw tiles, just blit bob
dynamic copperlist not working for "namco" logo

* can be worked on now:

controls: bomb not working
sprites for ship, bomb sight and shots and bomb!: superimpose 2 sprites to get more colors
compute 16-color palette for tiles, 16-color palette for sprites => create original RGB => reduced colors dictionary
revert to AGA dual playfield, scratch FG tiles ATM, keep dynamic color
for fg title tile flash
optim: do not sprite double draw if y>288 tile>36. Coded but still fg plane is destroyed
