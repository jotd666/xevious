* to see with Mark:

- find a way to make up for those shaking ground enemies
- optimize main/sub code more

* can be worked on my own:

- bonus flag is mirrored!
- hotkey (f1?) to toggle music: not working yet
- if game is running on chipmem, reduce the framerate??
- andor sprite flickers when appearing
- andor sprite trashed the second time it appears
- andor bombing doesn't work too well
- sprite position not 100% accurate (see andor bobs & sprites)
- andor genesis sound replays: should lock timer
- andor sprite doesn't disappear completely (only second part is hidden) on the bottom part
- title tiles missing (level 14) title tiles also with brown color config???
  related to hole in map???
  probably related to warning (improve the warning): 22:64: <PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=8x8 at 0x187C30614F0>: (x=0,y=0) rounded color (81, 81, 81) (#515151) not found, orig color (81, 81, 81) (#515151), maybe try adjusting precision mask 0 close colors: []
- level 14: tile layout looks wrong (bird drawing)
- implement dip switches screen ??
- optim: cookie cut with fixed B=0 source if plane_pic_0 (saves bandwidth)! blit_plane_any_internal_cookie_cut_blank_source
- not booting from real machine on CF card without whdload

further optims:

- 1 color lost because of fg tiles: not useable color is color 17: it is the color of the FG tiles
  we _could_ use it with a hack in the FG row copperlist (no color change) when nothing is displayed...
- a lot of blank sprites should just be NOT drawn (ex: clut 0)
- don't generate mirror X-sprites if log doesn't tell game is using it
- if no tile can be double width / double height AND simple at the same time
  generate 16x32,32x16,32x32 bob data directly for a fewer number of blits
