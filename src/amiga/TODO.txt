* to see with Mark:

- find a way to make up for those shaking ground enemies
- optimize main/sub code more
- level 14: black balls start with 4 toroids!!

* can be worked on my own:

- andor genesis sound replays 
- still missing sprites at area 14? (blue flashes)
- crash in draw_sprite_part (area 14): log parameters? (maybe because of bad andor clipping too)
- andor appearing sprite clipping is trashing the sprite, backup not working
- andor center tile is still a bob (is that a problem?)
- sprite backup system is not working for clipped y sprites as zeroing
  the base address X/Y isn't effective if sprite is being clipped: should
  reset the sprite pointer too
- real machine: currently lockup at start without whdload => still lockup on real machine, try with color codes at start
  => set custom copperlist, change color at each step
- real machine: test with more fps / enemies
- title tiles missing (level 14) title tiles also with brown color config???
  related to hole in map???
  probably related to warning (improve the warning): 22:64: <PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=8x8 at 0x187C30614F0>: (x=0,y=0) rounded color (81, 81, 81) (#515151) not found, orig color (81, 81, 81) (#515151), maybe try adjusting precision mask 0 close colors: []
- level 14: tile layout looks wrong (bird drawing)
- sheonite sprites too fast, seem to fail the sprite erase: log shenonite display & erase coords (code 48-57)
- implement dip switches screen ??


further optims:

- 1 color lost because of fg tiles: not useable color is color 17: it is the color of the FG tiles
  we _could_ use it with a hack in the FG row copperlist (no color change) when nothing is displayed...
- a lot of blank sprites should just be NOT drawn (ex: clut 0)
- cookie cut with fixed 0 source if plane_pic_0 (saves bandwidth)
- don't generate mirror X-sprites if log doesn't tell game is using it
- if no tile can be double width / double height AND simple at the same time
  generate 16x32,32x16,32x32 bob data directly for a fewer number of blits
