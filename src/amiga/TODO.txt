* to see with Mark:

- find a way to make up for those shaking ground enemies
- optimize main/sub code more
- level 14: black balls start with 4 toroids!!

* can be worked on my own:

- hotkey (f1?) to toggle music
- if game is running on chipmem, reduce the framerate
- andor sprite flickers when appearing: disable lifetime to check
- optimize bg tile draw even more
- 4 red glowing hulls of andor genesis HW sprite should be overlayed with
  BOBS (even if golden colors are blacked out) just to be
  able to be shut down by bombs (core is already a BOB) => when sprite color doesn't exist, replace by transparent (andor genesis glowing parts)
- andor genesis sound replays: should lock timer
- still missing sprites at area 14? (blue flashes)
- title tiles missing (level 14) title tiles also with brown color config???
  related to hole in map???
  probably related to warning (improve the warning): 22:64: <PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=8x8 at 0x187C30614F0>: (x=0,y=0) rounded color (81, 81, 81) (#515151) not found, orig color (81, 81, 81) (#515151), maybe try adjusting precision mask 0 close colors: []
- level 14: tile layout looks wrong (bird drawing)
- sheonite sprites too fast, seem to fail the sprite erase: log shenonite display & erase coords (code 48-57)
- implement dip switches screen ??
- optim: cookie cut with fixed B=0 source if plane_pic_0 (saves bandwidth)! blit_plane_any_internal_cookie_cut_blank_source
- not booting from real machine on CF card without whdload

further optims:

- 1 color lost because of fg tiles: not useable color is color 17: it is the color of the FG tiles
  we _could_ use it with a hack in the FG row copperlist (no color change) when nothing is displayed...
- a lot of blank sprites should just be NOT drawn (ex: clut 0)
- don't generate mirror X-sprites if log doesn't tell game is using it
- if no tile can be double width / double height AND simple at the same time
  generate 16x32,32x16,32x32 bob data directly for a fewer number of blits
